# Kotlin PlantUML Generator

> A **Gradle plugin** that generates **PlantUML** code from **Kotlin source files** to help you create **accurate, up-to-date UML diagrams** for your project.

---

## üì¶ Overview

This plugin is designed to automatically generate **PlantUML** code from your Kotlin codebase using the **Kotlin Symbol Processing API (KSP)**. The generated `.puml` files can be rendered using tools like `plantuml`, online editors, or IDE integrations.

The plugin is **open source**, **privacy-focused**, and **highly customizable**, allowing you to control what parts of your code are included in the diagrams.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Provide a **clear overview** of your Kotlin class structure.
- Help **API readers** quickly understand class relationships.
- Ensure **diagrams stay up to date** with your codebase.
- Avoid **data privacy issues** by not sending any user data to third parties.

---

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ **KSP-based symbol processing** for accurate Kotlin code analysis.
- ‚úÖ **Customizable configuration** (e.g., visibility filters, name exclusions, package grouping, ...).
- ‚úÖ **Integrated with Gradle** ‚Äî runs on every build.
- ‚úÖ **Privacy-first** ‚Äî only generates `.puml` code, no data is sent to third parties.
- ‚úÖ **Open source** ‚Äî contribute and extend the plugin!

---

## üìå Supported Kotlin Features

- Sealed classes
- Object declarations
- companion objects
- Suspend functions
- Extension functions
- Visibility modifiers (public, internal, private)
- Custom filtering of elements by name or package
- Collection element type resolving
- Generic element type resolving
- ...

---

### ‚öíÔ∏è Try it out

1. Clone this Repository.
2. Run `./gradlew :example:kspKotlin` to generate a Plantuml Classdiagram.  
3. The output can be found at `example/build/resources/main/ClassDiagram.puml`.  

The generated file can be rendered by using the Intellij Plantuml Plugin or on [Plantuml.com](https://plantuml.com/)

---

## üì¶ Installation

Add the plugin to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "2.1.21-2.0.1"
}

dependencies {
    ksp("io.github.tosaa.puml.ksp:ksp-plantuml-generator:0.0.+")
}

```

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Add the Plugin to Your Project**

Add the plugin to your `build.gradle.kts` file:


```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "2.1.21-2.0.1"
}

dependencies {
    ksp("io.github.tosaa.puml.ksp:ksp-plantuml-generator:0.0.+")
}

```

### 2. **Run the Gradle Task**

Run the following command to generate PlantUML code:

```bash
./gradlew :<modulename>:kspKotlin
```

> This will generate `.puml` files in the `<modulename>/build/resources/main/` directory by default.

### 3. **Render the Diagrams**

Use a tool like the [PlantUML CLI](https://plantuml.com/overview) or an online editor like [PlantUML Editor](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml) to render the `.puml` files.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can customize the plugin's behavior by 
passing a customized KSP configuration within the Kotlin-DSL 
or writing a configuration file 
and setup a custom gradle task.

### Example Configuration by configuration file
1. Define all required options in a file

MyConfig.conf
```
# comment
; comment
puml.allowEmptyPackage=true
```

2. Reference the file in a custom gradle task

```kotlin
tasks {
    register("generatePlantumlWithMySettings") {
        ksp {
            arg("puml.configFilePath", layout.projectDirectory.file("myConfig.conf").asFile.path)
        }
        dependsOn(findByName("kspKotlin"))
    }
}
```

The configuration file is based on the [INI file schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).
- Lines beginning with ; and # are interpreted as comments
- key and value settings are separated with '='
- Packages and Names can be separated with ','
- Boolean settings can be set with 'true' and 'false'

### Example Configuration within Kotlin-DSL

```kotlin
val customizedPlantumlConfiguration = mutableMapOf<String, String>().apply {
    // add all your settings here
    put("puml.allowEmptyPackage", "true")
}

tasks {
    register("generatePlantumlWithMySettings") {
        ksp {
            customizedPlantumlConfiguration.forEach {
                arg(it.key, it.value)
            }
        }
        dependsOn(findByName("kspKotlin"))
    }
}
```

## üìö Configuration Guide

### Configuration Templates

- [Default configuration](doc/default.conf) as .conf file _- is always a good way to start_
- [Public API configuration](doc/publicAPI.conf) as .conf file _- probably the best suitable configuration when you want to visualize your library_

<details>
<summary>KSP configuration for public API</summary>

```

val visualizePublicAPIConfiguration = mutableMapOf<String, String>().apply {
    put("puml.title", "Public API")
    put(
        "puml.prefix", """
skinparam class {
    BackgroundColor #fdf0d5
    classFontSize 16
    ArrowColor 003049
    BorderColor 003049
    FontColor 003049
    FontSize 20
}
    """.trimMargin()
    )
    
    put("puml.excludedFunctionNames", "<init>,equals,hashCode,toString")
    put("puml.showVisibilityModifiers", "false")
    // Only keep public API
    put("puml.showPublicClasses", "true")
    put("puml.showPublicProperties", "true")
    put("puml.showPublicFunctions", "true")
    // Hide internal and private 
    put("puml.showInternalClasses", "false")
    put("puml.showInternalProperties", "false")
    put("puml.showInternalFunctions", "false")
    put("puml.showPrivateClasses", "false")
    put("puml.showPrivateProperties", "false")
    put("puml.showPrivateFunctions", "false")
    // Actively show inheritance but skip property/function relations
    put("puml.showInheritance", "true")
    put("puml.showPropertyRelations", "true")
    put("puml.showFunctionRelations", "false")
    put("puml.showIndirectRelations", "true")
    // Show packages since they might be helpful for the API consumer
    put("puml.showPackages", "true")
    put("puml.allowEmptyPackage", "false")
}

ksp {
    // Add all configured options to the KSP environment
    visualizePublicAPIConfiguration.forEach {
        arg(it.key, it.value)
    }
}
```

## üìö Examples

### DataClass example
![example of how the uml looks like if a Data class is defined in Kotlin](doc/plantuml/DataClass.png)

### Companion object example
No additional `Class.Companion` entry is added but companion variables and functions are declared as static for the owning `class`.

![example of how the uml looks like if a Companion object is defined in Kotlin](doc/plantuml/CompanionObjects.png)

### Enums example

![example of how the uml looks like if an enum is defined in Kotlin](doc/plantuml/Enums.png)

### TypeAlias example

![example of how TypeAlias uml looks like if an TypeAlias is defined in Kotlin](doc/plantuml/Example_for_TypeAlias.png)

### Extensions example
Extension variables and functions can be marked as `<ext>`. Extensions of the Companion object are marked as static as well.

![example of how the uml looks like if an extension variable or function is defined in Kotlin](doc/plantuml/Extensions.png)

If extension variables and extension functions of classes from dependencies are implemented, their classes are displayed in a concise format.
This approach prevents the diagram from becoming cluttered by including all variables, methods, and inner classes from dependency classes.

![example of how the uml looks like if an extension variable or function is defined on an class in a dependency](doc/plantuml/ExtensionsOfExternalClasses.png)

### Interface example

![example of how the uml looks like if an interface is defined in Kotlin](doc/plantuml/Interface.png)

### Inheritance example

![example of how the uml looks like if one class inherits another in Kotlin](doc/plantuml/Inheritance.png)

### Objects example
Since `object` is equal to Singleton in Kotlin, it is highlighted with a red indicating color and the tag `<<object>>`.

![example of how the uml looks like if an object is defined in Kotlin](doc/plantuml/Objects.png)

### Sealed classes example

![example of how the uml looks like if a sealed class is defined in Kotlin](doc/plantuml/SealedClasses.png)

### Suspend functions example
Since coroutines and the concept of `suspend` functions is a very important detail in Kotlin, suspend functions can be marked as such in the final diagram as well. 

![example of how the uml looks like if a suspend function is defined in Kotlin](doc/plantuml/SuspendFunctions.png)

### Many types of relations example
Indirect relations like the Type of elements in a List or the Type of Result can be resolved too.
- Direct properties are visualized as solid line ending with a diamond.
- Indirect properties are visualized as dotted line ending with a diamond.
- Direct Function return types are visualized as solid line ending with an arrow.
- Indirect Function return types are visualized as dotted line ending with an arrow.

![Example of indirect and direct relations of properties and functions](doc/plantuml/IndirectRelations.png)

If a class has to many relations the diagram can get very hard to read.
Instead all relations will be hidden and a note will be added.

![Example of to many relations](doc/plantuml/ManyRelations.png)
